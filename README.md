# SIGMA GL/2 Draw I/O System
The SIGMA GL/2 is a reference implementation of a device driver for the Qwadro Draw I/O System, both developed by SIGMA Technology Group. It is based on Advanced OpenGL (v4) to deliver hardware acceleration in most of PC platforms.

This implementation requires OpenGL 3.2 by making use of argumentation in context creation. All other features used are expected to be available as extensions up to OpenGL 4.6 as it was published yet in 2017. The Qwadro project started in 2017, and should be fully functional with integrated GPUs up to 4 years before. This perspective has been originated of a regional market share evaluation. Qwadro Draw I/O System is first designed to operate with unified memory addressing. This model reflects the vision of future by SIGMA.

This implementation CAN use hardware acceleration resources not officially enabled and/or allowed by the IHV.
